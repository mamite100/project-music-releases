# Music Releases

Through mob-programming (3 person group) this project was to build a page showing Spotify's new album and single releases. We used React, created components and used data from downloaded Spotify API. 
## The problem
In this project we got to use React.js, HTML, CSS, JSX and React components, .map() to iterate over an array of data and mount many components and React props to feed information to components. We made a Miro board to plan our project and put the given “list of requirements” and design visuals there too. This was a very convenient way to get everyone on the same page and to quickly access instructions about the project in one place. We started the project by making sure we could catch the correct data needed from the downloaded API information in the JSON file. Then we went on with styling our page. If we had more time we would make the site richer through styling, functionality and data displayed.
